Instructions to complete the Introductions to Scientific Computing live in this document. 
Please follow the steps below to set up your environment before starting the lessons.
We will start with a brief introductions to Scientific Computing, followed by three practice sessions to get you familiar with BASH commands.

## Environment and datasets

<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
You will be using Google Colab to complete the exercises in this lesson. Colab provides a terminal environment where you can practice BASH commands without needing to install anything on your local machine.
To access the terminal in Google Colab, follow these steps:
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and sign in with your Google account. If you don't have a Google account, you'll need to create one.
2. Once you're signed in, click on the "Terminal" icon located in the lower left sidebar. This will open a terminal window within Colab.
3. In the terminal, type `cd sample_data` to navigate to a folder that contains some files you'll be using for practice.
You are now set up and ready to start learning BASH commands in the terminal environment provided by Google Colab!
